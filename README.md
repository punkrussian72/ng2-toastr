Angular Toaster Module (ng2-toastr-angular6)
===================

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-v4.1.2-brightgreen.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-toastr)

The lib is inspired by [ng2-toastr] (https://github.com/PointInside/ng2-toastr), and will show bootstrap-like toasts. 
The only difference is compatibility with Angular6. This is a tempoary package until Angular6 support won't be implemented in ng2-toastr.
